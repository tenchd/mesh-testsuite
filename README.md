Mesh PLDI Artifact
==================

Getting Started Guide
---------------------

The provided Linux virtual machine (in VirtualBox VMDK format) has a
user named 'mesh' with the password 'mesh', and should be able to
`sudo` without needing to enter the password.  The VM is recommended
to be run with 4 GB of RAM and 2 processors allocated to it.


Step-by-Step Instructions
-------------------------

There are 2 high-level steps for evaluating this artifact:

1. Running the benchmarks
2. Comparing the results to the claims in the paper

### Running the Benchmarks

```sh
$ ./run
```

Invoking the `run` script will kick off executing all benchmarks with
a larger number of iterations than run under "Getting Started" and
with reference workloads for SPEC.

This `run` script will also re-generate the figures used in the paper,
and parse the raw data (without deleting or modifying the raw data)
into tables that make evaluating our claims straightforward.


### Claims not supported by the artifact

At the end of Section 6.2.2 (Evaluation: Redis), we claim:

> During execution with Mesh, a total of 0.23s are spent meshing (the
> longest pause is 22 ms), while active defragmentation accounts for
> 1.49s (5.5× slower).

We believe this statement to be accurate, but were not able to
automate re-collection of this data into this artifact in the time
alloted.

### Common Problems

When running the Redis tests under Docker on macOS, we have seen Mesh
take an order of magnitude longer under the `fragperf` test.  We
believe this to be some issue regarding nested virtualization and page
table modification (as Docker on macOS manages a Linux VM under the
covers to run containers in), but haven't been able to track it down.
Restarting either Docker or the machine resolves the issue in some
cases.

### Evaluating Paper Claims

#### 0. Firefox

> Reduces the memory consumption of Firefox by 16% compared to Firefox’s bundled jemalloc allocator.

> Mesh requires 530 MB (σ = 22.4 MB) to complete the benchmark, while the Mozilla allocator needs 632 MB (σ = 25.3 MB).

This artifact reproduces these results, which can be verified via the data in the generated files `results/0-firefox/memory.relative.tsv` and `results/0-firefox/speed.relative.tsv`.


#### 1. Redis

> Using Mesh automatically and portably achieves the same heap size reduction (39%) as Redis’s active defragmentation.

> With Mesh, insertion takes 1.76s, while with Redis’s default of jemalloc, insertion takes 1.72s.

These results can be verified in the data in the generated files `results/1-redis/memory.relative.tsv` and `results/1-redis/speed.relative.tsv`.


#### 2. SPEC

> Mesh modestly decreases average memory consumption (geomean: −2.4%) vs. glibc, while imposing minimal execution time overhead (geomean: 0.7%).

> Perlbench.400: glibc peak RSS is 664MB, Mesh reduces its peak RSS to 564MB (a 15% reduction) while increasing its runtime overhead by only 3.9%.

These results can be verified in the data in the generated files `results/2-spec/results.tsv`.


#### 3. Empirical value of randomization

> Tested with Firefox + Redis and found no significant differences when randomization was disabled


##### Ruby example

> meshing disabled: similar runtime + heap size to jemalloc

> meshing enabled but randomization disabled: 4% runtime overhead, 3% reduction in heap size

> randomization on has time overhead of 10.7% compared to jemalloc, 19% heap size reduction

These results can be verified in the data in the generated files `results/3-ruby/memory.relative.tsv` and  `results/3-ruby/speed.relative.tsv`
